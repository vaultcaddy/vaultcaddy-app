**示例回复1: 关于小企业自动化的query**

```
Query: "Looking for experts to comment on small business automation trends"

Response:

Hi [Reporter],

I'm [Your Name], founder of VaultCaddy, where we've helped 500+ small businesses automate their accounting workflows.

Here's what I'm seeing in 2025:

Trend #1: AI-First, Not AI-Added
"Small businesses are no longer asking 'should we use AI?' They're asking 'which AI should we use?' The mindset has completely shifted."

Supporting data: 73% of our customers had never used AI tools before VaultCaddy. Now they're automating 3-5 other processes too.

Trend #2: ROI Expectations Are Instant  
"Business owners used to accept 6-12 month payback periods. Now they want ROI in the first month - and automation actually delivers that."

Example: Our customers save 20 hours on average in month one. At $25/hour, that's $500 saved vs $46 spent.

Trend #3: Automation Democratization
"Tools that cost $10,000/year three years ago now cost $50/month. Small businesses can now afford enterprise-grade automation."

Happy to elaborate on any of these points!

Best,
[Your Name]

**示例回复2: 关于会计技术的query**

```
Query: "Need accountant perspectives on how technology is changing the profession"

Response:

Hi [Reporter],

As someone who works with 500+ accounting professionals through VaultCaddy, I can share what's actually happening on the ground:

The Real Change:
"Accountants aren't being replaced by technology - they're being liberated by it. The question is: liberated to do what?"

The smart firms are using that time for:
• Proactive tax planning (vs reactive filing)
• Strategic CFO services
• Business advisory

Real example: One of our customers, an accounting firm in Hong Kong, automated bank statement processing and took on 15 more clients with the same 5-person team. Revenue up 30% with zero additional overhead.

The Risk:
"Firms that resist automation are creating a death spiral. They're spending more time on low-value tasks, which means less time for client relationships and strategy. Clients notice."

I'm happy to provide more specifics or connect you with one of our customers who's made this transition successfully.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
